<h1>Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction</h1>
<h2> Introduction</h2>

The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model for identifying churn among the credit card  customers. Churn, defined as the loss of customers to the competitors or the decision to discontinue service, poses significant challanges for financial institutions. This project was a part of my journey to learn more about how deep learning models can predict wheather the customer will churn or not.
